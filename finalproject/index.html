    <h2>Clash Royale</h2>
    <p> Clash Royale is a fast-paced Player  v. Player game. It was developed by Supercell. It was released globally in March 2, 2016. In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their experience level and trophy count. Players level up by gaining experience points through donating and/or upgrading cards and completing achievements. The highest possible level is level thirteen. As players progress and gain more trophies, they also progress through the 11 arenas. Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles - a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory. As they climb to higher arena's they're able to acquire more cards in chests.
