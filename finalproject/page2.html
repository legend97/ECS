    <h2>2v2 mode</h2>
    <p> One is the 2v2 map, where 2 pairs of players duel against each other. The major difference between the standard map and the 2v2 map is that there are 2 king towers instaed of one, otherwise, everything else stays the same. Note that there may be 2 king towers, but the value of both king towers together is still an automatic 3 crown. </p> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qNzu6Qmsp2M/maxresdefault.jpg"> </div>

    <h2>The Standard Map</h2>
    <p>In the standard map of Clash Royale, there are two sides where each players face off. In each of their respective sides, players, have 2 archer towers, and a king tower. The archer towers has less HP (health points) than the king tower, but does more damage. The king tower has more HP, but does less damage. Each archer tower is worth 1 crown, while the king tower is worth 3 crowns and is an automatic win for the first player to destroy the other's king tower. Ties are possible and can happen when the clock runs out and both players are tied in score, or when both players destroy each other's king tower at the same time. <img src="http://onlinefanatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Clash-Royale-Fight-on-Your-Side-of-the-Map.png"> </p>

    <h2>Touchdown mode</h2>
    <p>The other map is the touchdown mode map, where there are no towers, just a field. The objective in this gamemode is to attempt to get one of your troops to cross to your opponents "touchdown zone". Everytime a troop reaches the touchdown zone, it gets one point for the player that scored the touchdown and the game is reset. The player wins if he or she scores 3 touchdowns, or has more touchdowns in the designated time. Again, ties are allowed. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nq7ilzOeHX4/maxresdefault.jpg"></p>
